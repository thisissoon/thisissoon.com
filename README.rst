We make brands successful by combining insightful strategy, seamless technology, persuasive design and relevant content.

Installing
----------

To install create a python virtual environment and run `make develop`.

.. code::

    mkvirtualenv SOON_ --no-site-packages
    workon SOON_
    make develop

Running
-------

You need to expose a `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` environment variable which
contains a url to your database url, for example:

.. code::

    postgres://root@localhost:5432/soon

This can be done in a `.env` file and activated using `Autoenv
<https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv>`_.

You can run the application calling the following make command:

.. code::

    make runserver

Database Migrations
-------------------

Exposing models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Database migrations are handled by `alembic`. To expose models to the
`alemvic` environment you need to add the module to the BLUEPRINTS list in
the config, for example:

.. code::

    BLUEPRINTS = [
        'soon.auth',
    ]


Generating migrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the `migrations` directory does not exist you will need to run:

.. code::

    make db-init

You can then run the migrate command:

.. code::

    make db-migrate


Running Migrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To apply migrations just run the upgrade command:

.. code::

    make db-upgrade

Documentation Generation
------------------------

Documentation can be generated by running the following make command:

.. code::

    make docs-make

You can also view the docs by running:

.. code::

    make docs-serve

This will open the docs in your systems default browser in a new tab / window.
